# Expense

This is my project for [CSE 4050 at CSUSB](#). `Expense` is an expense tracking app \
that allows users to create an account and keep track of their expenses. `Expense` was \
written using `React`, and hosted using `FireBase`.

## How to run my application

### `The Easy Way`

The easy way to check out my application is to \
[click here](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `The Hard Way`

If you would like to view my application on your local machine, \
first you must make sure you have `react` installed to be able to run the program. \
In your terminal you can check by running the command `npm -v` and you will either get \
and output such as `6.14.10` stating what version of `npm` you have or else you will get \
and error message which means you must install `npm` first. If you must install npm click \
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to do so. If `npm` is installed then the first thing you must do is \
at this point is either `git clone` my repository or `download` my repository manually, than `extract` the files, \
and once you are in the `expense` directory run `npm install` to install all the necessary \
modules, this might take a while. After everything is install you can start the program by running `npm start` in your terminal \
and in your browser go to the URL http://localhost:3000 to view the website.
